Other Whole Foods in California Bay Area are not mismanaged the same way Thanks Whole Foods for sponsoring Reno Bites Week  I won a gift card Indian Tacos ftw This is the best Whole Foods Gotta eat here at least once a month So many great lunch and dinner togo choices Dont go on a Saturday afternoon It is a zoo Otherwise one of my favorite places to shop Had your kombucha today Great selection and good service Every time I come here I remind myself I shouldnt come back Sumo oranges Couple in front of me spent 108 on two bags of groceries and two gallons of water French dip sandwich here is over rated Recommended by both the counter worker and the cashier Quick lunch before pedi at Ocean Spa I am the only fat person in this place  Im not sure theyll let me stay symbol of excess that I am   My worst experience with a store I was shopping a t approximately 10pm I wanted some soup but there was just a little left in the container so I just took a ladle full to try out The cashier took the soup and Charged me for the whole container I explained that I just wanted to try it I was humiliated in front of other customers when she told me that I needed to go and ask the mngr Anyway the manager came and to my surprise denied my request to try the soup Peach pie tastes like peaches from a can  This place is busy on the weekends Was counseled not to put my recyclables in the recyclables in front of the store This Whole Foods employee kept in my face was obviously unstable and I had to keep backing up My Fluer Di Li complex doesnt recycle even though their HOA is 600 a month 
Ive watched the cart gathering employees clip side view mirrors so as not to walk the aisle of the parking lot 
One of the worst Whole Foods stores Ive shopped at Unfortunately even the employees dont care for their manager Best yummy groceries around  Love the free wifi Love the Food this is a fabulous excellent generous wellpatronized wf

obama Best butcher shop and one of the only remaining in Reno Fish selection is excellent too The midweek salad bars and hot food bars is more than just filling your belly with good and tasty food Its akin to a singles meeting spot of vibrant and sexy and health conscious people Nothing wrong their Delicious place for lunch Cheap samosas in self serve hot foods section Great bread Burner central at the moment People watching spectacular Such nice  young people work here The only store in Reno that carries difficult to find items Coconut flour is one if these items Thanks Whole Foods Beautiful quiet morning Why cant the checkers be able to use both lanes of the checkout at the same time One of the best WFM They have everything Im officially in love with this place Dont shop when Burning man shoppers are here Some stumbling high on drugs and then I saw a few stealing A bit unnerving for the law abiding shoppers Always a friendly atmosphere Their VEGAN DONUTS provided by Posh Bakery are better than normal donuts Deliciously decadent and comforting My fav is the crumb They have Valentines Day roses for all you last minute shoppers Did not have any of the four sale items I wanted as snacks for a Super Bowl party  I even had an employee check Best Organic Sourdough for 299 Best butcher in Reno The quality of there food keeps me coming back Salad was good WAAAAY over priced Pretension level is high I was run into by no less than 15 people all of which NONE said excuse me Free WiFi for 120 minutes Love Rory Reid just walked into Whole Foods So thats what a loser looks like up close  Go here for your gluten free items In addition to their gluten free section of snacks and things they also clearly label all of their gluten free items on the shelf throughout the store If youre looking for variety this is a great place to go But be prepared to drop a pretty penny on your groceries Healthy warm breakfast Again Beautiful cheese selection It wasnt on my list but I ended up buying four kinds when all was said and done A delicious oops 2 for 5 Pizza Slices Yeah Stoked to find the Tessemae brand here paleo Bummed they dont open until 8 am Buying food from Whole Foods will cost more than Walmart but you will save money in the long run on Doctor bill Food shopping heaven Valentines bouquets Sumos are in Dark chocolate Mocha at Allegro Coffee is yummers Download the app for coupons Yummy salad bar Potato samosas yummy Love whole foods but its pretty expensive Kerrygold grass fed Irish butter Great burgers but not worth a 30 min wait  Got the salad bar Three years laterSTILL no listed price on tacos Even with a new display These guys have a four cheese bread if you havent tried it is simply a must try Its incredibly delicious Place is a zoo today Nicest Whole Foods Ive ever been in Love the fire place and tap room They carry my favorite almond flavored champagne thats so hard to find in Reno Checking out all Whole Foods wherever I travel My tip is for the  staff  as long as you are charging as much as you do why dont you at least greet the guests say Hi And be at least a little bit friendly With as many workers stuffed into this place as there are I have never felt so ignored in a store EVERY time I shop there Protip2 At the salad bar  make yourself a breakfast bowl in the morning for 399 featuring fresh berries  different milks and cereals A great deal because they charge you for the bowl Not by weight Protip get a sandwichburrito card buy 10 get one free see cashier for details Amazing place Scrumptious macaroons When choosing one of their freshly made juices in the produce section make sure to check the date it was made on the label They come from Emeryville CA The fresher the better nutrients Heard some call this place Whole Paycheck and not too far off lol Some things are worth it Tip Dont shop here This place has a tap room Drink some beer before shopping Sort of a shee shee grocer but pretty cool in a funky way Located to the left of Sierra Trading Post Outlet Could use a better selection at the hot food isle Grabbing coffee with my sweets A bit small here Reminds me of the old one on Bascom  Food is still fantastic Festivelooking store at night Avoid Whole Foods the day before Burning Man I always seem to shop this day every year  A nicer area in Reno Your one stop shop for all hippy elitist jerkoffs Dropping off battery and cell phones Dinner before I shop Mmmmmmmmsalad bar Indian food and kombucha Beef its whats for dinner The vegan pizza is awesome We will come here for it every time we are in town So far we have come for a whole pizza two days in a row I would not recommend you get the red sauce on it Just get olive oil and the garlic spread type sauce Love this store Only place I can buy ingredients for our paleo diet Good food but people seem like they get dressed up just to shop here Bit pretentious It may be Hanukkah but they only make challah for Fridaywhat the hell whole foods Hanukkah is 8 days not 1 Always the best The best Whole Foods in Reno I love this store  Everything is so clean and looks pretty  The selection of crafted beer is amazing  All the seafood

This place is overall horrible and I would not suggest staying here Lastminute booking great price great food fun environment I will definitely stay here again I like the comment about the cracked and how would you know what a correct and look like if you were not a crackhead yourself and the other comment why would you call health services on a place that makes more money than you will ever see in your entire life dont you think they have the shift covered Stay somewhere else Im going to be calling health code services on this place  i paid for a room that was literaly used as a  crack den from the looks  of the drug pariphilia left in the room  the GOD HELP THIS ESTABLISHMENT So cheap Big ass room with a view Bring an extra pillow surge protector and small extension cord Only one outlet worked by the beds and we fought over it We had to rely on  our own devices for inroom entertainment as the tvchannel situation was miserable Never again"

you wait Instead of hashbrowns veggie fritters or sweet potato fries try the garlicParmesan fries with any breakfast dish Always good Veggie fritters Very Bad service All Im going to say is yes yes and yes The wait can be long but is so worth it Shitty Too busy with dirty hippies and food was not worth the insane wait This place is very popular so if we are a party of two we just seat at the bar

The cut was fixed after it was dried and straightened So now at this length I have no clue how Im suppose to straighten it Also there are waves still in my hair at the roots I came in with a fabulous asymmetrical cut that I only want a trim on the back and to make my angle sharper I had to walkout with my all my length gone in a cut not like the one I asked for I specifically stated I wanted to keep my length in the front I told her maybe a tiny bit off if you have too Review part 3

The owner was awesome and did what he had to do to fix it But that meant taking all my length They were all very nice but it took the girl 2 hours to jack my hair up and the guy maybe 10 to fix it by blending and chopping off any length I had left This is a nice place with friendly staff but I would only ever sit in the owners chair Honestly I want to cry But Im thankful to the owner for being nice and fixing the terrible hair cut given before Review part 5

Now I am angry with myself for giving a  tip I just feel double wronged Giving me something I didnt want taking all my length and then asking me to pay for it This is a hair nightmare I feel like I have TBoz from TLCs hair that she rocked in the early 90s Gross The more I type the angrier I get And I didnt want to leave a completely negative review so Im going to stop Review part 1

Well my hair was just butchered by a gal here then the owner attempted to fix it but the only way he could was to take all my length She started out fabulous gave me a nice massage when she washed my hair She listened about the length but couldnt seem to cut my hair right I have very thick wavy hair that has to be straightened in really short cuts so I have no clue how extremely fed up this is going to look when I try to fix it Review part 4

We all make mistakes it makes a great opportunity to learn and she did watch him fix my hair but still I lost ALL my hair And although my hair isnt a bad cut now its not the cut I wanted Yes she learned something but I can not be given back my hair And they charged me and I tipped because at the time I felt the owner deserved itAnd now my BF is pointing out that the girl charged me and put her name in the iPad as the stylist so she will receive that money"

till 0300 AM If your thinking about coming to this place during the holiday season DONT Its overly packed they wont take any special requests and the service is very slow I usually like coming here but it was a real disappointment Wor Wonton soup is phenomenal Theyve done a remodel this week that is just lovely Classin the joint up Oily as Pho Getting my banh mi fixnever had it from here so cross ur fingers Get the curry beef stew Lunch is busy in the fall Come early The Wor Wonton is phenominal Their pork fried rice is pretty bomb their chow mein is very oily and bland This place is packed only a fifteen minute wait but itll probably be close to a half hour before we get our food  Best fast Vietnamese close to campus Havent been in a while and the flavors are still spot on Avoid holidays It gets stupid busy Enjoy all other times This place has really good food the service on the other hand not so good Tip is they wont bring you a check you have a table  so when you are done you head to the front to pay and give them your table  Eat their spring rolls They do it so right Continually come here After 9pm the late night menu has some interesting options too The spicy soup with pig feet and blood is good Really great food Very rude older lady and very dirty Ended up getting food poisoning Hmmm looks as if Golden Flower has removed my review I guess they hate the idea of the public knowing they pour water glasses back into the pitcher as seen by a former customer Way to really hide your tail between your legs with that move Come for the food ignore the service    48 So yummy Spring rolls are a must have Good phone bunker Stays open late Great for a hangover coming that morning Food and service is a hit or miss Depending what time you go  Imperial egg rolls make this place 5 stars Ask for straws and be ready to order soon Lol I love this place When its not busy lol Good food and fast service Yummy as usual Hot soup on a cools day Yummy Wor Wontonfried rice I can eat by the pound Yummy ice coffee Very refreshing on a hot day Busy lunch and dinner plan accordingly No bean sprouts in spring rolls Trust me Pho so cold Late night menu Dragon fried rice some of the best fried rice in town pad thai here is actually better than most thai places here too Not authentic at all Pho super salty Straight up sucks Waited 50 min AFTER I ordered to get my food PLUS 20 min wait for table while tables were sitting there unbussed Manager was a dick Bad service Fuck this place Couple next to us was waiting forever they fell asleep Singapore noodles from the after 9pm menu is yummy Love it I usually finish work around 8pm and I dont get home until 8309pm which by then most restaurants are already closing shop However I can always count on Golden Flower to be open for a late night dinner 30 mins and still no pho unbelievable Spring rolls an any soup on the menu Mmmmm The wor wonton soup is the best Good food with good prices Horrible service but they have good food silver lining LOL Simply a good place to eat Open 24 hour which is nice very good Time to get my Vietnamese Coffee on Good food nice place to go if youre feeling like a midnight meal Their rolls arent the best but theyre ok My new favorite spot Missed dinner Dont trip Golden Flower is open til 3am Vietnamese coffee for the ride home Beware of what you ask for  They charge you for every little thing  They didnt give you enough bean sprouts  you ask for a bit more they dont say anything but suddenly 150 to your bill  Same goes for asking for any other little things  Pho noodles are very hard and generic  Pad Thai is way over salted  overpriced   water has a strange taste Its good coz they open late the lady owner need to learn about customer service Been coming here since 2004 I think ownership changed last year or something because the quality and service have gone down substancially Bland slow and inaccurate order taking Used to love this place Great food only real thing is it is really loud Belated birthday dinner with Jess  Best Pho in Reno And get the imperial rolls deep fried spring roll Got a great combination Pho great flavor dont even bother service is a negative 10

crappy  Imperial rolls are the best Im obsessed with this place 51 youre welcome Place is great a must in notown Skip this place Packed full of fellow Santa Crawlers Gota have pho before heading back to San Francisco I heard this place was good Recommended by a local Lets see Super fast efficient service  Pretty good food at decent prices  Food and soup comes out and stays piping hot especially important during cold weather   Note They will not bring the bill to you pay at counter and tell the cashier your table number  

Pictured is seafood chow fun seafood with wide rice noodle and fish in clay pot with side of rice  Both very flavorful and good Love this place Perfecr place to kill pho and asian food cravings Amazing Vietnamese food Their pho tastes very authentic and full of flavor I wish they had other traditional dishes such as Bun Bo Hue spicy beef noodle soup similar to pho The only downside is their service the Vietnamese servers are rude but thats how most Vietnamese restaurants are Thai tea is amazing Great place to eat Please run away from this place Horrible food and  worse service Free parking in the back Thankful to find Asian in Reno The food is so so Pho in dt reno before  Simply great food at a very reasonable price Whats wrong with Asian folks out of the Bay Area cant cook for shit Bad ass service too This is my regular spot Good prompt service The pho is amazing Get it to go Wor wonton with a side of noodles Dont eat here Not worth the terrible service Worst service ever

Bad customer service Hot August Nights so packed Make sure to be prepared for the frustrating detours they make you take due to street closures Rooms are nice for the low price wdeanski500 Fun The casino SUCKS 2 tables open on a Thursday Small What was once one of the best Hotels in Reno and where you got your besy bang for your buck is now just mundane  The only deals are the buffet where two seniors can eat for the price of one if you have their rewards card  The rest of the restaurants are somewhat pricy The staff is friendly which is big pluss but other than that the rest could use improvement  Bill Harrah would be rolling in his grave if he saw the place now  Personally I would only give it two stars"

httpwwwnewsreviewcomrenofooddrinkthewinnerscontentoid10929621 They added new menu items to the ayce Seaweed salad calamari and more Worth the drive If you like some spice get Tha Warden Very good Linens I feel special Great table sushi which is hard to come by Best sushi in sparks Hands down Get the offmenu better than sexual roll They are not extremely busy like they usually are but it is an extremely long wait between orders Good food but maybe takeout next time Their service has really gone downhill since opening their Reno sushi bar What happened to the other managers Great food fresh fish Awesome Summergazm If you want a good Yucatan appetizer go to Hiroba instead of here Otherwise Tha Joint is a close second to Hiroba as the best sushi in RenoSparks Dont skip the mussels app or the mochi for dessert both are part of the AYCE and sooo good So good oh my gosh Make a reservation especially on weekends One of my favorite sushi places in the RenoSparks area Wednesday night 15 minute wait at 740 Kitchen didnt close nor were people rushed past 9pm to finish Super busy around seven no chance at bar seating for party of five I suggest trying Tha Latingo roll I also suggest avoiding the Summergazm roll unless youre looking for a fruit salad dessert Its good but only as a couple pieces for dessert Its hard to eat the whole roll Mmmm mochi This place is great Try getting the rolls as a handroll if you are solo or not with a big group doing AYCE I find I can enjoy more of the selection that way Some of the best sushi in the RenoSparks area Gets busy arrival early

evening when they were packed inside most of the clientele were Asian which is always a good sign Between Starbucks  Subway Stop in for dinner rather then lunch As per traditional Asian style you get slightly more food for dinner then for lunch for the same price Also skip the boba first thing when they open as they arent quite ready yet Wait till around 1130 or noon before you get it or the boba

Love the death mule Best Moscow mule in Reno The atmosphere is great Its an ideal place for a couple people to casually meet for drinks Ask the mixologist to make you something off menu  Example I always ask for egg whites and vodka something Every time its crazy good and every time its different Drinks are overpriced unless you feel like paying for nicely cubed ice that is 75 of your glass Cheers Love the classes Wonderful retro prohibition swanky place Impressive mixology 1 Free Bart McCoy is not valid with check in  None of the employees knew whatwho it was   

 Its been taken down  Mixology  This is the place to be Opens at 5p Good but small and expensive drinks made with care and served with an attitude Try the El cid It was an ok bar Daiquiri with Diplomatico Venezuelan rum My newest obsession Cheers Let me know if you try it Bartenders are slow and borderline rude Love how everyone raves about using fresh ingredients I guess that makes drinking alcohol healthy  If your into fancy shmancy drinks then you will probably like this place  I thought the drinks were awful but Im a vodka seven rum  Coke kinda guy  Prices were outrageous the service was pathetic  Stood at the bar for at least ten minutes before the douchey bartender did me the favor of allowing me to order a drink  Go to chapel or St James and maybe this place will go out of business No food is served here So this is an excellent after meal spot I would suggest not going if you are hungry 5 rum punch for midtown art walk craft cocktails and house made syrups Me How do you get the big ice cubes so clear
Bartender We have the ice blocks shipped then the bar manager uses a chain saw to cut them up then whittles them to the perfect size 0 My kind of place Order the Penicillin I think this is my favorite bar in all of Reno The bartenders know their stuff and will steer you in the right direction towards deliciousness if you allow them Hint The Bill  Ward  Awesome Sitting is limited can be a trouble to get a spot on busy nights 

Good spot for a date night or small group 34 on weekdays Large selection with knowledgeable bartenders Omg its the most amazing Moscow Mule Ive ever had Great drinks Great atmosphere Mivhael is amazing Thx for a great visit  Yelp sucks Came in at 10 and it was closed May want to check before going Wonderful place I love this place Great bartenders food drinks mellow atmosphere Enjoyed it Danielle makes great drinks and was very informative with the craft cocktails two thumbs up for her and the Whiskey selection is superb This place is awesome Truly was amazing with her knowledge and customer service Dope  Love the aesthetic and bartender makes good drinks Incredible cocktails and bourbon selection Hidden gem in Reno NV Great service"

patio eating and great food Cant go wrong with mimosas and the Banana rum French toast and lobster benedict The Banana Rum French Toast is BOMB Lovely  atmosphere and good service Pricey but will go back The Stonehouse is over rated  food is good service blows  the staff are poorly trained on customer service They are open 7 days a week for breakfast lunch dinner Stone House is easily one of Renos top 5 restaurantsI visit at least 3X per week Was trying to book a baby shower  Was handled very unprofessional  felt like an afterthought  Ended up giving it at Bertha Mirandas which was awesome Best outdoor dining in Nevada Still one of our favorite places to eat Outside seating when its nice like today Hostess is not very friendly Seating process is a mess Were being made to wait even though we can see 2 empty tables in front of us Curious Fantastic experience hands down favorite restaurant Great food There is a wait for places such as this that is usually a good thing

service  Will write our review soon   Youve got to try this place Excellent food enough said The Stone House might just have the best Fish Tacos in town Just absolutely the bomb Great  healthy fresh ingredients we both loved them Try them for yourself The only thing I really dont like about this place is how BUSY it is Always be sure to make a resie or arrive early Arrive early due to parking The escargot is phenomenal and so are the mojitos I come here quite often Staff and atmosphere is always accommodating and friendly Try the Wasabi Bloody Mary Food undercooked then overlooked lame Bring your well behaved dog and sit outside She was brought her own water dish and a cookie Amazing Period Yum yum yum On Sundays be willing to wait or come when they first open Parking can be difficult They definitely do not like children here The owner told my kids to be quiet Terrible Come try the French onion soup Prices currently posted online are incorrect and they will NOT honor them Its best to get your Oder in right away for faster service Dont come hungry because you will get hangry Waited more than half an hour for our food to come out Great dinners wonderful breakfast Had a terrible experience at the Stone House The service was slow waited an hour for our food  the waiter was rude when I mentioned it The ahi salad is yumtastic And best when washed down with a glass of sparkling chandon or a signature stonetini  Try the San Diego Best seared ahi sandwich in Reno no contest Great Fountain Garlic mashed potatoes lava cake and calamari are the best Healthy options too Get the paella if they have it on special Yummy EXTREMELY RUDE Save yourself the trouble I have been to alot of places and seen some bad customer service but this place takes the cake on being the absolute worst place around The waiter david was beyond horrible and when encountering the owner it all made sense why such behavior is tolerated there Im actually pretty shocked that places like this can keep the doors open Trust me fellow yelpers AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COST Veggie hash Excellent food and staff

noodles and soup are all flavorful and perfectly seasoned  Ox Tail Pho is also excellent  grab it before they run out daily  Ox tail is cooked perfectly and has a chew to it and not overly cooked where it just falls apart  Noodles did not clump and soup is piping hot  This place know its Pho thats for sure Lunch with my bff jazzy phea salt n pepper calamari n fried rice are delicious All I wanted was honey walnut prawns but it was only mentioned in 4 previous Yelp reviews and was mentioned poorlyfood poisoning Guess I will choose elsewhere Theres an OK place   Its plain Great food but the only downside of this place is the slow service Long wait and not being acknowledged when coming in  Not coming back Much better than I expected Ill be back Ordered takeout lunch special with what was suppose to be wonton soup This restaurant provided me with a cup of hot chicken broth with a piece of lettuce in it along with a side of cold bean sprouts and 2 jalapeño slices Really  Why not just be honest they do not serve wonton soup even though it is on menu very disappointed  The special honey chicken tasted like frozen chicken nuggets in sauce food is really bad Hope they improve
